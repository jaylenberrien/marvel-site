        <p>I've been into superheros and supervillians since I was a kid. When I was younger I would have at least one or two comics in the books I brought home. One of my favorite parts was finding cool new characters to read about. I think that's a experience worth sharing with others. </p>
        <p>Superhero fans and people who are exploring those types of stories will enjoy this site (Team Marvel specifically <em>*cough* *cough*</em>)</p>
