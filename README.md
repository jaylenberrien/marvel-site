Im going to be making a Marvel Comic site

I want you to be able to search for different characters and comics that they are in

I plan on using:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- React
- A marvel web API

Getting the api to work the way that I want them to is the the things that I expect to be the hardest thing

You can access the site here:
