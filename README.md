I made a Marvel Question Site

You are able to search for different information about comic books and their characters

I used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- React
- A marvel web API

Getting the api to work the way that I want it to is the the things that I expected to be the hardest thing.

Things that I learned:

- I originally had issues with getting the api to work because of a hash issue I hadn't resolved
- I learned a lot of ways to manage files to make them easier to search through and manage that I'll definitely use in future projects
